## Create `.demo.yml` for Signal Vault

Based on the project context, I'll create a `.demo.yml` file with values inferred from the codebase:

### File: `.demo.yml`

```yaml
status: concept

title: Signal Vault

pitch: A community-driven idea marketplace that transforms how business concepts are validated, valued, and brought to market through collective intelligence and gamified equity

category: fintech

platform: lovable

featured: false

cover_prompt: A futuristic digital vault with glowing signal waves emanating outward, representing ideas being validated and valued by a connected community network

tags:
  - idea-marketplace
  - community-validation
  - gamification
  - ai-powered
  - equity-distribution
  - roi-simulation
```

### Reasoning for Each Field

| Field | Value | Rationale |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| status | `concept` | Project is functional but not published (no live URL) |
| title | Signal Vault | Direct from project name |
| pitch | Community-driven idea marketplace... | Captures the core value proposition from README |
| category | `fintech` | The equity, valuation, and ROI features make this financial-tech focused |
| platform | `lovable` | Built entirely on Lovable |
| featured | `false` | Default per schema |
| live_url | *omitted* | Not published yet |
| cover_prompt | Futuristic vault with signals... | Evokes the "vault" concept with community validation imagery |
| tags | 6 relevant tags | Covers: marketplace, validation, gamification, AI, equity, ROI |

### Notes
- No `live_url` included since the project isn't published yet
- No `demo_video` since none is available
- Status set to `concept` rather than `draft` because the app is fully functional with all 7 development phases complete, just not deployed to production
